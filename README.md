# PROJECT FRED ON BOARDING

# THE PROBLEM
As an INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR (IFA) with COL, FBR has a hard time getting his clients onboarded for COL accounts. There is a tedious amount of email exchange that goes on before a client can sign up for an account, wasting both the IFA and the client’s time and energy. 

# THE SOLUTION
A simple, intuitive interface called FredOnBOARDING  that allows FBRs’ clients to easily input their credentials and information on an intuitive and well-design interfaced, which will then be immediately copied on a COL form and automatically sent to FBR.  CLIENT also downloads a COMPLETE FORM.  FBR will submit COMPLETE CLIENT ACCOUNT OPENING form to COL IFA secretary to OPEN COL ACCOUNT. 

COL will email CLIENT and FBR (or IFA AGENT) of the approved COL ACCOUNT that includes the CLIENT’s COL Account NUMBER.
